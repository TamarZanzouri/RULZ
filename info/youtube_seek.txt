player.seekTo(seconds:Number, allowSeekAhead:Boolean):Void
Seeks to a specified time in the video. If the player is paused when the function is called, it will remain paused. If the function is called from another state (playing, video cued, etc.), the player will play the video.
The seconds parameter identifies the time to which the player should advance.

The player will advance to the closest keyframe before that time unless the player has already downloaded the portion of the video to which the user is seeking. In that case, the player will advance to the closest keyframe before or after the specified time as dictated by the seek() method of the Flash player's NetStream object. (See Adobe's documentation for more information.)

The allowSeekAhead parameter determines whether the player will make a new request to the server if the seconds parameter specifies a time outside of the currently buffered video data.

We recommend that you set this parameter to false while the user drags the mouse along a video progress bar and then set it to true when the user releases the mouse. This approach lets a user scroll to different points of a video without requesting new video streams by scrolling past unbuffered points in the video. When the user releases the mouse button, the player advances to the desired point in the video and requests a new video stream if necessary.
